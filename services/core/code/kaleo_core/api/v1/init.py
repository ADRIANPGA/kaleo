# If you have specific 'init' endpoints in your OpenAPI spec that fall under 'default_api_base',
# you would implement their methods here.
# For example, if BaseDefaultApi had a method like 'async def system_health_get(self) -> HealthStatus:'

# class InitApiImpl(BaseDefaultApi):
#     async def system_health_get(self) -> HealthStatus:
#         # Your implementation here
#         return HealthStatus(status="OK")

# Ensure this module is imported so that InitApiImpl (if defined) registers itself.
# If this 'init.py' module doesn't directly implement parts of BaseDefaultApi,
# but other modules it imports do, that's fine too.

# For now, if 'init.router' was a previous concept for a FastAPI router,
# and you are now using the generated server's router,
# you might not need to define 'router' here.
# If 'init' refers to specific methods in BaseDefaultApi, implement them in a class here.
